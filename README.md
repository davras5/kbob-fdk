## Overview

The **KBOB BIM Data Catalog** is a web-based reference for Building Information Modeling (BIM) data requirements used in public construction projects across Switzerland. It provides standardized building element classifications, Level of Information (LOI) requirements per project phase, and IFC mappings — all in one accessible place.

This catalog is published as a **demonstration and reference implementation** of how a coordinated, cross-organizational BIM data reference can support interoperability and consistent data management across federal, cantonal, and municipal builders.

> **Status:** This is a demonstration. Transitioning this catalog into an official KBOB resource would require formal governance, mandate, and long-term content stewardship.

**Live demo:** https://davras5.github.io/kbob-fdk/

## Why It Matters

Public organizations across Switzerland are increasingly required to use BIM for planning, construction, and asset management. Federal policy under the **Digital Switzerland Strategy** promotes improved digital processes and data interoperability across the construction lifecycle.

In practice, many public authorities have developed BIM data requirements independently. This has led to inconsistent definitions, duplicated effort, and friction at handovers between project phases and organizations.

The KBOB BIM Data Catalog addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Reduced ambiguity** — one shared definition understood by all
- **Improved interoperability** — consistent data flows across organizations and lifecycle phases
- **Lower barriers to adoption** — small municipalities benefit from the same clarity as larger agencies

This catalog demonstrates how coordination can be implemented in practice across public builders.

## Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Open by default** | Code, data, and methodology are public; no framework lock-in |
| **Linked data & Once-only** | Data requirements are defined once, connected to national reference data and dictionaries, enabling reuse and integration with the Swiss Data Ecosystem |
| **Interoperable by design** | Based on open standards to ensure seamless data exchange and stability |
| **Lifecycle-oriented** | Information requirements follow the building lifecycle from planning through operation and deconstruction |

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Five Integrated Catalogs** | Elements, documents, BIM use cases, discipline models, and EPD sustainability data |
| **Phase-Based Requirements** | Geometry and information requirements mapped to project phases across the building lifecycle |
| **IFC Mappings** | Direct mapping of elements to IFC 4.3 classes and predefined types |
| **Authoring Software Templates** | Element mappings for BIM authoring tools (Revit, ArchiCAD) alongside exchange format mappings |
| **REST API** | Public API with Swagger UI documentation for programmatic access to all catalog data |
| **BPMN Process Diagrams** | Interactive workflow diagrams for each BIM use case |

| **BIM – Simplifying Construction through Better Data Interoperability** | Digital Switzerland action plan measure to improve data interoperability in construction | https://digital.swiss/en/action-plan/measures/simplifying-construction-through-better-data-interoperability--bim- |
| **Strategy for Digital Methods (BLO / ASTRA)** | Federal strategy for BIM and digital methods within building and infrastructure authorities of the Swiss Confederation | https://www.kbob.admin.ch/de/digitalisierung-und-bim |
| **KBOB Digitalization & BIM Guidance** | KBOB recommendations for lifecycle-oriented BIM and data management | https://www.kbob.admin.ch/de/digitalisierung-und-bim |

The overarching objective is to define data once and reuse it consistently across planning, construction, operation, and long-term asset management.

## Data Model
The catalog comprises five independent entity types, each stored as a standalone JSON file. The model is explicit and technology-agnostic to support reuse across organizations and software systems.
