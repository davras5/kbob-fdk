# KBOB Fachdatenkatalog Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** KBOB Fachdatenkatalog (KBOB BIM Data Catalog)

**Purpose:** An open-source, web-based reference catalog for Building Information Modeling (BIM) data requirements in Swiss public construction projects. It defines standardized building element classifications, Level of Information (LOI) requirements per project phase, and IFC mappings to reduce data ambiguity and improve interoperability across federal, cantonal, and municipal construction organizations.

**Target Users:**
- Federal, cantonal, and municipal authorities
- Public and institutional building owners
- Infrastructure operators and portfolio managers
- Architects and planning consultants
- Engineers and contractors
- BIM coordinators
- Software vendors and system integrators

**Current Status:** Production demonstration with comprehensive data model, five integrated catalogs, multilingual support, and REST API implemented
