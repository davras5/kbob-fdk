# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose and Goals

The KBOB Fachdatenkatalog data model serves as the foundation for standardizing BIM requirements across Swiss public construction projects.

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Standardization** – Provide a consistent structure for defining BIM requirements that can be referenced in Auftraggeber-Informationsanforderungen (AIA) and BIM-Abwicklungspläne (BAP)

2. **Interoperability** – Enable data exchange through alignment with international standards (IFC, ISO 19650) and Swiss e-government architecture, supporting the federal digital transformation agenda

3. **Lifecycle Coverage** – Support all lifecycle phases from development through decommissioning, with phase-specific requirements for geometry, information, and documentation

4. **Traceability** – Maintain version history and change tracking for audit purposes in public procurement contexts

5. **Discoverability** – Enable filtering, searching, and cross-referencing across multiple classification systems and lifecycle phases

## 1.2 Strategic Alignment

This data model contributes to Swiss federal digitalization initiatives:

| Initiative | Scope | Relevance |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| [Strategie Digitale Bundesverwaltung](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/digitale-bundesverwaltung.html) | Federal administration digital transformation | Foundational strategy for digital services |
| [eCH-0279 Architekturvision 2050](https://www.ech.ch/de/ech/ech-0279/1.0.0) | E-government architecture vision | Target architecture for cross-agency data exchange |
| [Strategie Digitale Schweiz – BIM-Massnahme](https://digital.swiss/de/aktionsplan/massnahme/vereinfachung-des-bauens-durch-bessere-dateninteroperabilitat) | Construction data interoperability | Action plan for simplifying construction through better data interoperability (2023–2027) |

The catalog supports the goal of establishing non-discriminatory interoperability principles that benefit all construction stakeholders, from routine task automation to end-to-end data continuity across the building lifecycle.

## 1.3 Design Principles

The data model follows these guiding principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Phase-driven requirements** | All requirements (LOG, LOI, documentation) are tied to specific lifecycle phases, allowing progressive detail as projects advance |
| **Multi-classification** | Entities support multiple classification systems simultaneously to bridge Swiss, German, and international standards |
| **Separation of concerns** | Geometry (LOG), information (LOI), and documentation requirements are modeled as distinct concerns with independent phase applicability |
| **Self-describing** | Each entity carries sufficient metadata (version, lastChange, description) to be understood in isolation |
| **Extensible structure** | Nested collections (classifications, attributes, roles) allow entities to grow without schema changes |

## 1.4 Localization

**Current State:** The data model is currently implemented in German (DE) only.

**Future State:** Multi-language support for German (DE), English (EN), French (FR), and Italian (IT) is planned. Localized attributes will include `title`, `description`, controlled vocabulary values, and labels.

The underlying data structure and controlled vocabulary codes will remain language-neutral to ensure consistency across locales.

# 2. Conceptual Model

## 2.1 Entity Overview

The catalog manages five main entity types:

| Entity | Purpose | Key Relationships |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Element** | Physical building components with geometry and information requirements | Referenced by Models; linked to Documents |
| **Document** | Project documentation types with format and retention specifications | Referenced by Elements; supports all phases |
| **UseCase** | Standardized BIM processes with roles and responsibilities | References Standards; defines workflows |
| **Model** | BIM discipline and coordination model definitions | Contains Elements; spans phases |
| **EPD** | Environmental impact data for materials (KBOB Ökobilanzdaten) | Supports sustainability analysis |

## 2.2 Entity Relationships

The data model follows ISO 19650 principles where **UseCase** serves as the central organizing entity. Use cases define both the process (descriptive, via BPMN) and the information requirements (prescriptive), linking to all other entities.

### Relationship Summary

| Relationship | Cardinality | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| UseCase → Element | M:N | Use case defines which elements are required with specific LOG/LOI |
| UseCase → Document | M:N | Use case specifies required deliverables |
| UseCase → Model | M:N | Use case involves contributions from discipline models |
| UseCase → EPD | M:N | Sustainability use cases reference environmental data |
| Element → Document | M:N | Elements have documentation requirements |
| Element → EPD | M:N | Elements linked to environmental product declarations |
| Model → Element | M:N | Models contain/reference element types |
| Element → IFCMapping | 1:N | Element maps to IFC classes (exchange) |
| Element → RevitMapping | 1:N | Element maps to Revit categories (authoring) |
| Element → ArchicadMapping | 1:N | Element maps to Archicad tools (authoring) |

### Phase Applicability

All entities share lifecycle phases **except EPD**, which contains phase-neutral reference data:

| Entity | Has Phases | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| UseCase | ✓ | Use cases apply to specific lifecycle phases |
| Element | ✓ | LOG/LOI requirements vary by phase |
| Document | ✓ | Delivery timing tied to phases |
| Model | ✓ | Model maturity evolves through phases |
| EPD | ✗ | Environmental data is phase-neutral reference data |

## 2.3 Design Rationale

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **UseCase-centric** | UseCase aggregates requirements for Elements, Documents, Models, and EPDs (ISO 19650 EIR/AIA pattern) |
| **Dual-purpose UseCase** | Prescriptive (what to deliver) + Descriptive (how to execute, via BPMN) per VDI 2552 Blatt 12.1 |
| **Phase filtering** | All entities except EPD share lifecycle phases, enabling phase-specific views |
| **Multi-system mapping** | Elements map to exchange format (IFC) and authoring tools (Revit, Archicad) |

# 3. Shared Concepts

## 3.1 Common Attributes

All entities share a base set of attributes for identification, versioning, and discoverability:

| Attribute | Format | Constraint | Required | Description |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Entity-specific pattern | ✓ | Unique identifier within entity type |
| `version` | String | – | ✓ | Version indicator for change tracking |
| `lastChange` | Date | ISO 8601 | ✓ | Date of last modification |
| `title` | String | – | ✓ | Human-readable display name |
| `image` | String | – | ✓ | Visual representation reference |
| `category` | String | Entity-specific vocabulary | ✓ | Primary grouping for filtering |
| `description` | String | – | ✓ | Detailed explanation of purpose and scope |
| `tags` | Collection[String] | Anwendungsfeld; min. 1 | ✓ | Keywords for search and filtering |
| `phases` | Collection[Integer] | 1–5 | ○ | Applicable lifecycle phases |

## 3.2 Lifecycle Phases

All phase-dependent attributes reference the lifecycle phases of a building or asset. The phase model is based on VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2, which aligns with research by Bergische Universität Wuppertal (WUP) and provides a region-neutral framework compatible with national standards.

| Phase | English | German | French | Italian | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Development | Entwicklung | Développement | Sviluppo | Comprises project development and awarding of planning services (e.g., feasibility studies for existing buildings) |
| 2 | Planning | Planung | Planification | Progettazione | Consists of basic evaluation, preliminary planning, design planning, approval planning, and execution planning (e.g., object and specialist planning) |
| 3 | Construction | Realisierung | Réalisation | Realizzazione | Includes awarding of construction work, work preparation, construction execution, and construction acceptance (e.g., fabrication and assembly planning) |
| 4 | Operations | Betrieb | Exploitation | Gestione | Encompasses awarding of building services, operations, and use (e.g., operator responsibility) |
| 5 | Demolition | Abbruch | Déconstruction | Decostruzione | Includes demolition planning and demolition execution (e.g., decommissioning management) |

### Phase Standard Mappings

| Standard | Region | Mapping |
|----------|--------|---------|
| VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2 | DE | Primary reference for lifecycle phases |
| WUP BIM-Handlungsempfehlung | DE (region-neutral) | Research foundation |
| SIA 112 | CH | Phases 31, 32, 41–53, 61, 62 |
| HOAI | DE | Leistungsphasen 1–9 map across phases 1–3 |
| ISO 19650 | International | Information delivery stages |

### Phase Usage Rules

- Phases are represented as integers 1–5
- Phase collections indicate when an entity or requirement is applicable
- Requirements may span multiple phases or be phase-specific
- Empty phase collection implies applicability across all phases

## 3.3 Classification Systems

The catalog supports multiple classification systems to enable cross-referencing between Swiss, German, and international standards:

| System | Standard | Region | Primary Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| eBKP-H | SN 506 511 | Switzerland | Cost planning for building construction |
| DIN 276 | DIN 276:2018 | Germany/DACH | Cost classification |
| Uniformat II | ASTM E1557 | International | Elemental cost classification |
| KBOB | Federal standard | Switzerland | Swiss federal building classification |
| IFC | ISO 16739-1:2024 | International | Open BIM data exchange |

### eBKP-H Codes

This is only an overview of the main standard.

| Code | Value (EN) | Value (DE) |
|------|------------|------------|
| A | Land/site acquisition | Grundstück |
| B | Site/surroundings | Umgebung |
| C | Shell construction | Rohbau |
| D | Building services | Technik |
| E | External wall claddings | Äussere Wandbekleidungen |
| F | Roofing | Bedachung |
| G | Interior finishes | Ausbau |
| I | Furnishings/equipment | Ausstattungen |
| V | Ancillary costs | Nebenkosten |

## 3.4 Tagging System

### Purpose

The tagging system provides a controlled vocabulary for categorizing and filtering entities across the catalog. Unlike free-form keywords, tags are drawn from a standardized set of values to ensure consistency, enable reliable filtering, and support interoperability with external BIM platforms.

### Design Goals

1. **Consistency** – All entities use the same tag vocabulary, enabling cross-entity search and filtering
2. **Interoperability** – Tag values align with VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2 to support exchange with German BIM platforms (e.g., BIM-Portal von BIM Deutschland, buildingSMART UCM)
3. **Discoverability** – Tags complement the primary `category` attribute by providing secondary classification dimensions
4. **Extensibility** – New tags may be added following the extension rules defined in VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2 Section 6.3

### Normative Reference

**VDI/DIN-EE 2552 Blatt 12.2:2024-03** – Building Information Modeling: Metadaten zur Identifikation von BIM-Anwendungsfällen

This standard defines the metadata structure for identifying BIM use cases on platforms. The `Anwendungsfeld` (application field) metadata provides the controlled vocabulary for the tagging system.

### Tag Values (Anwendungsfeld)

The following tag values are derived from VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2 Anhang B1:

| Value (EN) | Value (DE) | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Acceptance | Abnahme | Acceptance and handover processes – Use cases that utilize data for the acceptance of the overall project and/or parts of an overall project (e.g., defect and acceptance management) |
| Change Management | Änderungsmanagement | Change management – Use cases that utilize data for quantifying and qualifying changes, tracking them, and billing them if necessary (e.g., change tracking) |
| Tendering and Procurement | Ausschreibung und Vergabe | Tendering and procurement – Use cases that utilize data for preparing and creating tender and award-relevant information (e.g., specifications for construction work tendering) |
| Requirements Planning | Bedarfsplanung | Requirements planning – Use cases that utilize data for establishing project requirements and supporting site and procurement variant studies (e.g., plausibility check of quantities and masses in planning) |
| Asset Capture | Bestandserfassung | Asset capture – Use cases that capture data from assets and other relevant inventory and make it usable for data-based process steps (e.g., property capture) |
| Operations | Betrieb | Operations – Use cases that utilize data to support and/or optimize operations (e.g., energy management) |
| Documentation | Dokumentation | Documentation – Use cases implemented for documentation purposes (e.g., building documentation) |
| Approval | Genehmigung | Approval – Use cases that particularly concern the approval process (e.g., public-law review and approval) |
| Commissioning | Inbetriebnahme | Commissioning – Use cases implemented to support commissioning processes (e.g., commissioning management) |
| Coordination | Koordination | Coordination – Use cases that support coordination of services, models, project communication, etc. (e.g., coordination and integration of planning) |
| Costs | Kosten | Costs – Use cases that utilize data for determining, verifying, and optimizing costs throughout the lifecycle (e.g., cost estimation according to DIN 276) |
| Logistics | Logistik | Logistics – Use cases that utilize data to support logistics processes (e.g., logistics concept) |
| Feasibility | Machbarkeit | Feasibility – Use cases that utilize data to create a project study (e.g., feasibility study for new construction) |
| Sustainability | Nachhaltigkeit | Sustainability – Use cases that utilize data to assess and/or optimize sustainability aspects (e.g., sustainability certification) |
| Verification | Nachweise | Verification/Analysis/Expert reports – Use cases concerning the performance of verifications, expert reports, or calculations, including occupational safety verifications (e.g., dimensioning and verification) |
| Quality Assurance | Qualitätssicherung | Quality assurance – Use cases that utilize data to ensure quality in a project, including legal quality assurance (e.g., progress recording and control of construction work) |
| Risk Management | Risikomanagement | Risk management – Use cases that utilize data for identifying, assessing, controlling, and tracking risks (e.g., maintenance and inspection management) |
| Scheduling | Termine | Scheduling – Use cases that utilize data for calculating, planning, verifying schedule information and relationships (e.g., execution scheduling) |
| Variant Comparison | Variantenvergleich | Variant comparison – Use cases that utilize data to compare different variants of a scenario (e.g., planning variant comparison) |
| Insurance | Versicherung | Insurance – Use cases that support the implementation of insurance processes (e.g., building documentation) |
| Visualization | Visualisierung | Visualization – Use cases that utilize data for graphical representation and/or analysis (e.g., visualization of object and specialist planning) |
| Other | Sonstiges | Other – Use cases that cannot be assigned to any other application field |

### Application Rules

1. **Minimum Requirement** – Every entity must have at least one tag assigned
2. **Multiple Tags** – Entities may have multiple tags when applicable to several application fields
3. **Primary vs. Secondary** – The `category` attribute defines the primary classification; tags provide supplementary classification
4. **Consistency Across Entities** – The same tag vocabulary applies to Elements, Documents, UseCases, Models, and EPDs
5. **Extension Policy** – Custom tags outside the VDI vocabulary should be avoided; if necessary, use "Sonstiges" or propose additions through governance process

### Relationship to VDI 2552 Metadata

The tagging system implements the `Anwendungsfeld` metadata from VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2. Other VDI metadata map to catalog attributes as follows:

| VDI 2552 Metadata | Catalog Attribute | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Bezeichnung | `title` | Display name |
| Beschreibung | `description` | Detailed description |
| Version | `version` | Version indicator |
| Datum der Veröffentlichung | `lastChange` | Last modification date |

# 5. Constraints and Rules

## 5.1 Identification Rules

| Entity | Pattern | Example | Rule |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| Element | `e{n}` | e1, e15 | Unique within Elements |
| Document | `{O\|K\|B\|V}{nnnnn}` | O01001, K02003 | First letter indicates KBOB category |
| UseCase | `uc{nnn}` | uc001, uc030 | Sequential numbering |
| Model | `m{n}` | m1, m10 | Unique within Models |
| EPD | `kbob-{nn}-{nnn}` | kbob-01-042 | Aligned with KBOB database |

## 5.2 Integrity Rules

1. **Version Consistency** – When an entity is modified, `version` and `lastChange` must both be updated

2. **Phase Validity** – All phase values must be integers between 1 and 5 inclusive

3. **Phase Inheritance** – Nested requirements (geometry, information, documentation) may only reference phases that are included in the parent entity's phase collection

4. **Tag Requirement** – Every entity must have at least one tag from the controlled vocabulary (see [3.4 Tagging System](#34-tagging-system))

5. **Classification Consistency** – Classification codes should be valid within their respective systems (e.g., eBKP-H codes should follow SN 506 511 structure)

6. **IFC Mapping Validity** – IFC class references should conform to IFC 4.3 schema

7. **Document Category Alignment** – Document IDs must use the correct category letter prefix (O, K, B, V) matching the assigned category

8. **UseCase Category Alignment** – UseCase categories must be valid Anwendungsfeld values per VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2

## 5.3 Referential Guidelines

1. **Model-Element Relationship** – Model element names should correspond to defined Element titles where applicable

2. **Document References** – Element documentation requirements should align with defined Document types

3. **Role Consistency** – UseCase role names should be consistent across use cases to enable cross-referencing

4. **Standard References** – Referenced standards should use official designations (e.g., "SIA 2051", "ISO 19650-1", "VDI 2552 Blatt 12.2")

5. **Model Category Consistency** – Model category values must be one of the defined categories (Discipline Models, Coordination, Special Models, As-Built)
